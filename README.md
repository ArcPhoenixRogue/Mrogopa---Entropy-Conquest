# Mrogopa---Entropy-Conquest
Flame all around. A blinding star, strange trees... upon gathering yourself, your spaceship has crashed into a strange world. A fragmented message relays your status as a settler upon this world, sent as part of the last hopes for the people of Mrogopa to have a new home, as Entropy is nearing the total devouring of your home planet.

A first attempt at making a challenge pack (not quite the level of an expert one), built on the following principles:
- Freedom is the enemy of creativity
- Reducing bloat and overlap to a minimum
- Intertwined progression and a cohesive connection between mods, supplementing each other with their own quirks and personality, rather than competing against one another
- Progression is (attempted) to be naturally driven, rather than simply locking and unlocking entire mods at once
- Automation
- Research
- Combat
- Exploration
